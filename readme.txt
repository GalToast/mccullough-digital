This theme ships with a build pipeline powered by `@wordpress/scripts`.

1. Run `npm install` to set up the toolchain.
2. Use `npm run build` to compile block assets for production.
3. Use `npm run start` during development to watch and rebuild block scripts.

Compiled files are written to `build/blocks/*/editor.js` and referenced automatically by each block's `block.json`.
